Use of Cooldown 1. Setting Time This function will change its cooldown value to the time the function was executed. Cooldown : Set () 2. Resetting Time Will reset cooldown value to zero. Cooldown : Reset () 3. Getting Time This function will get the value saved in cooldown. local Time = Cooldown : Get () 4.
